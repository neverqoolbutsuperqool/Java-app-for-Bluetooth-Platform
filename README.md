# Java-app-for-Bluetooth-Platform
Bluetooth communication in Java can be platform-dependent and might require specific libraries for different operating systems. BlueCove, for instance, works primarily on Windows and Linux. On macOS, you might consider using the Apple's CoreBluetooth framework with JNI (Java Native Interface).

You need to download the BlueCove library from its official website: http://bluecove.org/. Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform.
